# walkthrough

We made a little walkthrough to help interpret our code, data, and analyses.
Check out the rendered version of this walkthrough [here](https://netneurolab.github.io/markello_transcriptome/)!

HUGE thanks to [The Executable Book Project](https://executablebooks.org/en/latest/) for creating the resources that allowed us to do this!
